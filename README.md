## Introduction 🚀

Pneumonia is a lung infection that can be life-threatening if left untreated. Early and accurate diagnosis is crucial for effective treatment. This project leverages machine learning techniques to classify chest X-ray images as pneumonic or normal, assisting healthcare professionals in the diagnosis process.

## Installation 💻

To run this project, you'll need Python 3.x and the following libraries installed:

- TensorFlow
- Keras
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- OpenCV

You can install the required libraries using pip:

## Usage 🧑‍💻

1. Clone the repository:
2. Navigate to the project directory:
3. Run the Jupyter Notebook:
4. Open the `pneumonia_detection.ipynb` notebook and follow the instructions.

## Model 🤖

The project employs a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture for classifying chest X-ray images. The model is built and trained using TensorFlow and Keras libraries. Details about the model architecture, hyperparameters, and training process are provided in the Jupyter Notebook.

## Data 📊

The dataset used in this project is taken from the study "Identifying Medical Diagnoses and Treatable Diseases by Image-Based Deep Learning" (https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(18)30154-5). The dataset consists of 5216 subsets of chest X-ray images, which can be found on Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia).

The dataset is preprocessed and split into training and validation sets before being fed into the machine learning model.

## Results 📈

The trained model achieved an accuracy of at least 0.9 on the validation set. Upcoming are performance metrics, such as precision, recall, and F1-score, along with visualizations and examples of the model's predictions.
